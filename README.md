# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project focuses on developing an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions. The primary objective is to extract and transform data, resulting in the creation of four CSV files. These CSV files will then be utilized to generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Lastly, the transformed data from the CSV files will be uploaded into a Postgres database.

Resources folder contains the four csv files and two excel files from which data was imported.
